# Data-Analysis-Project-Exploring-Airbnb-Listings-in-Brooklyn-New-York
This project aims to analyze Airbnb listings data in Brooklyn, New York, to gain insights into rental prices over time and by different room types. The dataset initially contains Airbnb listings data for all neighborhoods in New York City, but it has been cleaned and filtered to include only the Brooklyn neighborhood. By focusing on Brooklyn, we aim to provide targeted insights that are relevant to both hosts and guests in this specific area.

The dataset contains information about various aspects of Airbnb listings, including prices, room types, and review dates. Through data analysis and visualization, we will uncover trends, patterns, and relationships within the Brooklyn Airbnb listings data, providing valuable insights for both hosts and guests in the area.
 By exploring this dataset, we aim to answer questions such as:

How much are the rooms priced in various places in Brooklyn?

What are the average rental prices for different room types (e.g., shared room, private room, entire apartment)?

Is there any correlation between the review dates and rental prices?

Through data analysis and visualization, we will uncover trends, patterns, and relationships within the Airbnb listings data, providing valuable insights for both hosts and guests in the Brooklyn area.
